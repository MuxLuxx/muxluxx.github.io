      <description>Defcon 31 &amp;amp; BlackHat USA 2023 with Friends Overview This year was the first year I was able to come back and see my friends at Defcon &amp;amp; Black Hat. The experience was wonderful! I got to meet people that I have been talking to for years online but never met. One of those wonderful people was Admiral! He has been my mentor since 2020 when I first joined the DC801 Defcon Group.</description>
