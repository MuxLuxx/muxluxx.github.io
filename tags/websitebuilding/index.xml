      <description>Blog about fixing things&amp;hellip; Fixing things can be hard especially when you are starting out for the first time. Sometimes you need a helpful goose (admiral) to help you out.
Sometimes you are fine and then something happens and you mess up. If you can&amp;rsquo;t figure it out, ask around and get some help. Usually for me that is a goose that flies around on my screen and honks at me when I need to look at something.</description>

      <description>What even are websites and how to build a post? I have been learning alot from my friends at DC801. Recently, I have been working on a special projec t that I have been working with them on. I can&amp;rsquo;t say much but involves a certain little mage. Hope you all will like it and try to keep an eye on all the different things on DC801 and my twitter for more information as well!</description>
