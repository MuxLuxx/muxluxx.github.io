      <description>Mux&amp;rsquo;s changes and what to do next? Recently, I have been gone for quite a while and the reason for this was due to my streaming schedule. I also for some time ran a shop on Etsy but unfortunately had to close down due to the amount it was costing me to run this. I had to pay an additional closing cost along with this. I have had to close shop eventhough I would have perferred not to.</description>

      <description>Where have I been? I have been gone for quite a bit and I decided to post of where I have been and why I have been gone recently. The reason for me being gone is depressingly enough is depression. I have struggled with it in the past and things I use to find enjoyment in are no longer making me happy. Why is this? I have had people who I was decently close to pass away and I am trying to deal with it.</description>
