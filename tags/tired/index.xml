      <description>Where have I been? I have been gone for quite a bit and I decided to post of where I have been and why I have been gone recently. The reason for me being gone is depressingly enough is depression. I have struggled with it in the past and things I use to find enjoyment in are no longer making me happy. Why is this? I have had people who I was decently close to pass away and I am trying to deal with it.</description>
