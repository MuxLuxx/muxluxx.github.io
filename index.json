    "body": "Defcon 31 \u0026amp; BlackHat USA 2023 with Friends Overview This year was the first year I was able to come back and see my friends at Defcon \u0026amp; Black Hat. The experience was wonderful! I got to meet people that I have been talking to for years online but never met. One of those wonderful people was Admiral! He has been my mentor since 2020 when I first joined the DC801 Defcon Group. We had always talked online and done classes where he taught me how to code, create things and most importantly FILL ALL THE DATABASES WITH GOATS!~ My new found obsession. (lol)\nI also got to attend my first village that I was able to participate in, The Hardware Hacking Village! I was able to fix a badge and learn to make new things. The people there were so nice and really amazing, they treated me well/taught me so much in the small time I was there. I had an amazing time with my friends and I got to know that eventhough I do not know what I am doing there are amazing, smart people that are there to help. One example, The Lockpicking Village, the instructors there helped me lock pick for the first time and it has become a passion for me recently. Youtubers McNally and LockPicking Lawyers have been amazing influences for me to learn this craft and has been really a driving force to keep going in the community.\nBlackHat USA was great as well! I got to work with my past group and got to see old faces that I haven\u0026rsquo;t seen in over 2 years. I honestly missed my friends and this was something I really needed after a ROUGH last 2 years. I learned alot from SeaQuill and TJ. They also got me a badge where I was able to talk to people in a short range. This was an amazing experience! I loved working with everyone and loved getting to hang out with everyone.\nBiggest Regret: Not seeing Hacker Jeopardy Biggest Wish Come True: Meeting Admiral \u0026amp; Joining PepperCon\nDream Big and Eat Spicy, my friends!\n-MuxLuxx\n",

    "body": "Mux\u0026rsquo;s changes and what to do next? Recently, I have been gone for quite a while and the reason for this was due to my streaming schedule. I also for some time ran a shop on Etsy but unfortunately had to close down due to the amount it was costing me to run this. I had to pay an additional closing cost along with this. I have had to close shop eventhough I would have perferred not to. At this moment, I would like to focus on new things and trying to get to do different things. I recenty re-created my pwnagotchi I needed for a project from a year ago and am currently working on making the app with DC801. I think it is good to review whether things are good or bad to keep on doing. Sometimes the things you put time into do not give you the outcome or as much as you need them to bring out.\nGood news is! Good new everyone! I will be coming back and updating more info from here to better help myself and document more of my IT progress. Hope you all enjoy the updates and have fun seeing progress reports from me.\nThank you so much.\n-Crystal (Mux)\n",

    "body": "Where have I been? I have been gone for quite a bit and I decided to post of where I have been and why I have been gone recently. The reason for me being gone is depressingly enough is depression. I have struggled with it in the past and things I use to find enjoyment in are no longer making me happy. Why is this? I have had people who I was decently close to pass away and I am trying to deal with it. My stream schedule is stagent and the only things that have been constant are my streams with WBSG. I have been trying to get myself up in the morning and despite trying to motivate myself, it\u0026rsquo;s super tough and I am fighting through my depression. There are so many thoughts going through my head of \u0026lsquo;I should be farther in my field\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Am I good enough to be here?\u0026rsquo;. My friends have really tired so hard to motivate me but I feel so drained and dead inside. I know I am not alone and despite this I am still struggling.\nI feel as though I have failed in most things I have tried to accomplish recently, espically with my etsy shop. I feel as though I should have done more to make others interested or put more into marketing myself. I recently am taking a break from my DC Groups and the reason for this is due to the help I was getting and learning Python, I didn\u0026rsquo;t feel like I was not experimenting on my own. That was my fault and I started to lose what I loved. I am so thankful to people like Admiral Potato who have tried to help me through this time but I need to walk away for a while to re-discover why I got into IT to begin with. In the meantime, I am spending more time alone either going to more bookstores and studying my ass off to learn how good of an IT Tech I can be. I am still learning and I am trying my best to get there. I have imposter syndrome and I know that most IT people do but I need to do things to remember why I get up in the morning. I love my job and what I do but I need to remember why I went into IT and need time to self learn. I need to go on my own for a while to make cool stuff and re-discover tech again.\nWhat am I doing in the meantime? So far, I have read through a bunch of books - some IT and some not. I am challenging myself to read and study more than I have ever studied before. I need to remember why I do the things I do and I am taking some time to make some cool stuff with the knowledge that my friends have taught me. I have been working on a project from a year ago. I am getting back into some things and taking apart different components, working on certs, working on my resin shop and streaming on the side. I hope to learn more python, shell, powershell and bash.\nI want to do some really cool things and re-discover who I am. This is not the first time and I want to make everyone proud. But also, be reliable for others. In the meantime, I will update from here and keep sharing what I learn. I need to do this myself and get myself out of the mess I got myself into. Will let y\u0026rsquo;all know what I learn from here!\nHope to update yall more and more and sorry for not posting. In the meantime, please enjoy this and show me what ya got!\nMuch love and support!\n-Mux\n",

    "description": "Mux talks about being an adult.",
    "body": "Lately, I have been looking into what is important and what I need to do. Honestly, one of the most important things I learned recently is what I want in my life and how to achieve it. For me, recently I have been getting into body building and fitness due to my fears of being overweight. I started to have weight issues when I was young becuase I loved sweets and thought I could eat anything. I was also a soccer player, colorguard girl and genuinely fit person. Although, when I got older this changed. I went from running every morning at 5 am and extreme exercises to dreading getting up in the morning and having no reason to. I had a hatred for almost everything I did and I had to step back and realize what was making me miserable.\nTo be honest, alot of it came from COVID but there were still issues even before COVID too\u0026hellip;\nI kept promising myself to lose weight every year until I can. I realized alot of how people look, talked and treated me was what made me upset. I realized I also put myself in many situations that had made me hate myself too. I kept prioritizing all my desires over my needs. I realize what I have done to myself and how harmful this can be to myself worth and how it can be to the people around me who love me as well. I have been putting my mental, physical and emotional health on hold and finding cheap alternatives to make me happy. At the end of the day, shit sucks.\nBeing an adult is hard but putting your better well being over your wants is going to lead you to success. Being an adult means managing money, family, time for yourself, work, spending time with friends, fixing things, cleaning things, figuring out what to eat, how to schedule, plan and prioritize. Shit be tough. I have been struggling with all of this in the meantime, I can not thank my friends for being there with me as I do this. I want to be what I picture myself to be. I want to be strong, save money, be on my own and live my own life. I want to be independent and explore places. Try new things.\nI want to be able to live my life and explore and unforuntely, I lead myself to a place where I can\u0026rsquo;t do that.\nThis also accounts for IT as well. I said I was going to get my certs but I failed to and I unforuntely let myself get sucked into playing too many video games. I have become a hermit and this is not healthy for me at all. I need to become independent for my own well being and so I can finally be able to rely on myself versus others. I hope that I can show my progress on here and continue to improve more and more.\nI have been doing alot of progress and I think frustration has been the motivating factor in this as well.\nI am glad that I can start to see progress and start to do things again. I think alot of people have kind of put me down and I said ok due to peer pressure.\nBook recommendation: Life Changing Magic Of Tidying Up by Marie Kondo (read the whole thing and I love it)\nIf this helps anyone, please feel free to reach out and hopefully we can do this together!\nUsually Dm\u0026rsquo;s are best on twitter\nMuch love and keep going.\nMux ",

    "body": "Progress is key! Hope you all are having a wonderful fall so far and are enjoying the wonderful weather!\nI want some cinnamon iced coffee or horchata. Please horchata\u0026hellip;\nBack on topic, progress is important and learning is part of that process. Recently I have been looking over my life to re-evaluate a couple of areas that I can improve. A couple of these areas are as follows -\nHealth/Fitness IT Knowledge Learning to save money These areas are where I fall flat on. These areas is where I seem to fail on and that is ok but what is not ok is to allow it to eat you up and stay negative about it. Learning from your mistakes and making progress is important but continueing to grow in your success is important as well. As a whole, I have tried to encourge friends of mine to continue in something that they have done but sometimes they discontinue their goals and fall back to failure. I realized something as I was looking into the reason this is, they have to realize it themselves and see their own progress as worthy. Humans can be wonderous creatures that make amazing things but sometimes we fail at some of the most basic things. For example, others may see progress but you don\u0026rsquo;t. People may tell you that you are making progress, but you don\u0026rsquo;t see it. Humans are terrible at seeing their own progress and we have become so frustrated with quick satisfaction.\nI am VERY guilty of this.\nWe get upset or angry and when we don\u0026rsquo;t see progress, we can feel discouraged. I completely understand that. It happens and we can feel defeated. Although, the opposite is true. You do make progress and make great things but only if you give it your all and stay consistent. When you do that, you are will feel better about what you have accomplished.\n| One example: If a Body Builder only benchs 250 pound weights but never trains anything else, are they a good Body Builder?\nNo. They can only do one thing but they can\u0026rsquo;t do others and are not a full body builder and fail to fully develop their full potential. They may be good but they will never continue to improve if they don\u0026rsquo;t exceed what they are comfortable with and jump into new opportunities.\nAs Uncle Iroh said, \u0026ldquo;If you gain knowledge from only one place, it becomes frail and ridged. You will need knowledge of all 4 nations.\u0026rdquo;. In this case, you will need to keep learning and keep growing along with training. You need to step out of the \u0026ldquo;fire nation\u0026rdquo; and grow to learn from others and improve as much as you can. Progress will come and results will be there but you need both sides of doing the thing, continuing to do said thing and improving/learning more. Learning IT is like weight lifting - get to know people, study, exercise, grow, work, continue, \u0026ldquo;lift heavy ass weights\u0026rdquo; and stay positive/do things to stay on a forward path. It is hard but at the end of the day, everything is hard and choose to make things that will be hard but beneficial for you vs hard and terrible for you. unfortunatley, some of those things will be friends, family or people you respect. It will be hard but if it matters to you then continue to proceed forward. There will always be temptations and disappointment but having people around you, seeing your improvement and where you started and challenging yourself is how to help yourself from falling. Also, remember to love you, things that make you happy and people you care about.\nTech Spot! In this file, I learned how to use Json to edit the code to make this post. My friend Admiral and Taz where helpful to show me this and has really helped with learning JSON. I think that I still need some work on this and need to keep trying this out. It is really neat and JSON has been helpful for me learning things like data types such as objects, arrays, string, number and boolean. This has helped me to understand coding a bit more but I will still need practice, but I am improving.\nHope this helps and feel free to reach out! We are all working on something and it is good to promote one another versus demote. Jealousy is a killer and even a virus. Be kind, drink some water and catch yall later.\n-Mux\n",

As a whole, I think this challenge has proven two things.\nI have no idea how to use linux. I am very far behind my friends in IT. One of my biggest regrets in IT, is not taking the time to look into tech. Even with all the falling I have done, I still need to practice. So far, I have at level 20 for the badge and this is because I have been learning alot from my friends. I have also been updating alot of my secret level and trying to learn HTML as well. Alot being thrown at one time. I suggest if you are new in IT to learn how to do the bandit challenge, get to know some people and ask if you need help. Reddit has been really helpful but nothing beats having a friend there to help. Make some friends, do some tech and have fun.\nAlso, save your passwords and how to do each level so you can refer back to it later.
