IT Support Specialist, Girls Who Code Advocate, Security/DevOps Novice and GCU Cyber Center of Excellence Volunteer Lead. I am also a streamer and Twitch Affiliate. I volunteer my time with different IT organizations and work as a Lead CA every year at Black Hat USA. 

> My favorite things are scary movies and memes about raccoons. 

I have always had a love of tearing things down and building them back up. I made IT clubs with GCU and helped to build their range because of this love.

>I may have accidentally stripped some cables in the process... (Sorry).

I have always liked things that allow me to be creative, when I was in my teens I was in marching band, colorguard, art club and FCCLA. Competition is good but I prefer healthy competition, one where even if I win or lose I can make a friend or two along the way and learn new things in the process. 

> I always like to stay busy.

I find it helpful to jump from many different projects and themes. I really liked being apart of a group of making something. I always hope to find different projects. I love playing video games too though. You can often find me playing DBD, League (I know what some of yall think about it), Animal crossing, Mario kart and Resident Evil.
