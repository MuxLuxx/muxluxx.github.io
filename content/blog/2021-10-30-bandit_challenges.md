The bandit challenge has been one of the most interesting challenges to date for me. I am really new into tech and need to catch up with my friends. 
As a whole, I think this challenge has proven two things. 

> 1. I have no idea how to use linux.

> 2. I am very far behind my friends in IT. 

One of my biggest regrets in IT, is not taking the time to look into tech. Even with all the falling I have done, I still need to practice. So far, I have at level 20 for the badge and this is because I have been learning alot from my friends. I have also been updating alot of my secret level and trying to learn HTML as well. Alot being thrown at one time. I suggest if you are new in IT to learn how to do the bandit challenge, get to know some people and ask if you need help. Reddit has been really helpful but nothing beats having a friend there to help. Make some friends, do some tech and have fun.

> Also, save your passwords and how to do each level so you can refer back to it later. Just in case... (Don't pull a Mux.)

It is great and you learn so much. Below are the references I suggest to try out!

Have fun and Linux on my friends! Feel free to reach out, I am new so I will not have all the answers but I can always ask.
