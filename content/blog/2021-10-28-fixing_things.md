# Blog about fixing things...

Fixing things can be hard especially when you are starting out for the first time. Sometimes you need a helpful goose (admiral) to help you out. 

Sometimes you are fine and then something happens and you mess up. If you can't figure it out, ask around and get some help. Usually for me that is a goose that flies around on my screen and honks at me when I need to look at something. 
>Honk Honk!~

These goose give me life and also with a friend of mines invention it has helped me to learn. Shout out to Admiral Potato from DC801. 
>Much good, Much friend.
