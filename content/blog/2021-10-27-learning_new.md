# What even are websites and how to build a post? 

I have been learning alot from my friends at DC801. Recently, I have been working on a special projec t that I have been working with them on. I can't say much but involves a certain little mage. Hope you all will like it and try to keep an eye on all the different things on DC801 and my twitter for more information as well!

As a whole, I really love working with everyone and using Github and Hugo to make new things. I hope that I can get more into learning about coding and networking. This marks I believe 3 months of learning. I feel like I should know more but I am not sure.

I will get there I just don't know what to do next. I need to look into more courses and stuff like that.
