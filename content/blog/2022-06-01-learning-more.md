# Mux's changes and what to do next?

Recently, I have been gone for quite a while and the reason for this was due to my streaming schedule. I also for some time ran a shop on Etsy but unfortunately had to close down due to the amount it was costing me to run this. I had to pay an additional closing cost along with this. I have had to close shop eventhough I would have perferred not to. At this moment, I would like to focus on new things and trying to get to do different things. I recenty re-created my pwnagotchi I needed for a project from a year ago and am currently working on making the app with DC801. I think it is good to review whether things are good or bad to keep on doing. Sometimes the things you put time into do not give you the outcome or as much as you need them to bring out. 

Good news is! Good new everyone!

I will be coming back and updating more info from here to better help myself and document more of my IT progress. Hope you all enjoy the updates and have fun seeing progress reports from me. 

Thank you so much.
