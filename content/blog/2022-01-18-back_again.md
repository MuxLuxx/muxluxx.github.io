# Where have I been?

I have been gone for quite a bit and I decided to post of where I have been and why I have been gone recently. The reason for me being gone is depressingly enough is depression. I have struggled with it in the past and things I use to find enjoyment in are no longer making me happy. Why is this? I have had people who I was decently close to pass away and I am trying to deal with it. My stream schedule is stagent and the only things that have been constant are my streams with WBSG. I have been trying to get myself up in the morning and despite trying to motivate myself, it's super tough and I am fighting through my depression. There are so many thoughts going through my head of 'I should be farther in my field' and 'Am I good enough to be here?'. My friends have really tired so hard to motivate me but I feel so drained and dead inside. I know I am not alone and despite this I am still struggling. 

I feel as though I have failed in most things I have tried to accomplish recently, espically with my etsy shop. I feel as though I should have done more to make others interested or put more into marketing myself. I recently am taking a break from my DC Groups and the reason for this is due to the help I was getting and learning Python, I didn't feel like I was not experimenting on my own. That was my fault and I started to lose what I loved. I am so thankful to people like Admiral Potato who have tried to help me through this time but I need to walk away for a while to re-discover why I got into IT to begin with. In the meantime, I am spending more time alone either going to more bookstores and studying my ass off to learn how good of an IT Tech I can be. I am still learning and  I am trying my best to get there. I have imposter syndrome and I know that most IT people do but I need to do things to remember why I get up in the morning. I love my job and what I do but I need to remember why I went into IT and need time to self learn. I need to go on my own for a while to make cool stuff and re-discover tech again. 

# What am I doing in the meantime?

So far, I have read through a bunch of books - some IT and some not. I am challenging myself to read and study more than I have ever studied before. I need to remember why I do the things I do and I am taking some time to make some cool stuff with the knowledge that my friends have taught me. I have been working on a project from a year ago. I am getting back into some things and taking apart different components, working on certs, working on my resin shop and streaming on the side. I hope to learn more python, shell, powershell and bash. 

I want to do some really cool things and re-discover who I am. This is not the first time and I want to make everyone proud. But also, be reliable for others. In the meantime, I will update from here and keep sharing what I learn. I need to do this myself and get myself out of the mess I got myself into. Will let y'all know what I learn from here!

Hope to update yall more and more and sorry for not posting. In the meantime, please enjoy this and show me what ya got!
